## Projects
### Object Detection and Tracking in 360 Degree Videos
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)
We proposed a new method to detect and track object in the
360-degree videos. For this matter, we created our own 360- degree video dataset, and by leveraging of ROI technique and
selecting a correct area of the image and then project it in 2D image we gain computational frugality as well as a better
precision compared to previous works. (fall ’2020)

### SuperResolution-based Edge Assisted 360-Video Streaming System
[Publication]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9666114))
We explore a new three-tier architecture to
handle the streaming of 360 videos to help reduce the bandwidth capacity on the core network of these cloud providers. (fall
