# Computer scientist

I am a Computer Engineer/Scientist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with a focus on advanced multimedia systems, immersive technologies, and distributed systems. My research spans various domains, including 360-degree video streaming, AR/VR content distribution, and blockchain applications for networking. With a strong foundation in both theory and practical implementations, I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of technology to solve complex real-world problems.

Over the course of my academic and professional journey, I have developed a diverse set of technical skills, from computer vision, optimization techniques, deep reinforcement  to cloud computing and blockchain-based solutions. I have also contributed to innovative projects that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications, including the development of protocols for immersive meeting environments and scalable blockchain architectures for network accountability.

I am deeply committed to contributing to the field of computer science through research and innovation, and I am eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals and institutions to advance the frontiers of technology.

## Projects
### Object Detection and Tracking in 360 Degree Videos

We proposed a new method to detect and track object in the
360-degree videos. For this matter, we created our own 360- degree video dataset, and by leveraging of ROI technique and
selecting a correct area of the image and then project it in 2D image we gain computational frugality as well as a better
precision compared to previous works. (fall ’2020)
For this project I used a pre-recorded 360 videos of a basketball game and made my own dataset.
